smokeLess
This is an app that will assist somebody in their efforts to quit smoking cigarettes. It will track and display a few different statistics to try to help people stay motivated to not smoke cigarettes.

Created by Joseph McKinney, 2018.
Description
The plan for smokeLess is to build an application that will keep track of how much time has passed since somebody quit smoking and a few different statistics surrounding their own personal smoking habits such as: how much money they may have saved, the number of cigarettes they would have smoked, some of the different health benefits they may have experienced in the time since they stopped and at which point along the way they experienced them, and the amount of time the may have saved by not smoking.

MVP
Ideally, at minimum smokeLess should be able to keep track of and display:

Elapsed time since a user last smoked. The time should be displayed on the homepage in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
Number of cigarettes they would have smoked based off of number of days smoke-free multiplied by how many cigarettes they smoked per day on average.
Amount of money they will have saved, based off of how many cigarettes not smoked, divided by how many cigarettes in each pack, and then that number multiplied by cost per pack of cigarette.
Amount of time they would have spent smokeing cigarettes, based off of how many cigarettes they smoked per day and about how long each cigarette took to smoke.
Display a timeline to the user of what kind of health benefits are experienced and when they should be expected based off of the average persons experience.
I would also like for the user to be able to create posts of some sort to share with other users to help be supportive by sharing experiences and tips that they have. For the MVP I plan to make a form that a user can fill out and be able to submit to a list of pre existing posts that will be saved as initial state for a post list.
Reach Goals
After getting my MVP in place I would like to spend some additional time:

Adding ability for multiple people to create user accounts.
Making it so that people are able to use the "posting" interactively. I think being able to support other people would be a key feature in this app, but I want to be realistic in what I set out to accomplish so this will be a reach goal. People should be able to share a post that can be either an anecdote, support, advice, anything they feel could be helpful to somebody else's success. I also want people to be able to reach out to a group for help, or
Create an option for people to be able to message each other directly or access individuals instead of a group incase they need some support.
Tools, libraries, frameworks, and other technologies
